# Projection Motivation
Information relating to the Data Science field is ubiquitous, but it is a bit overwhelming for a beginner when searching the internet for basic information because most authors are too technical and write at a low abstraction level that contribute to some beginners getting confused about Data Science. I was definitely confused when I first started out, as such I am cognizant of how difficult it can be to get the correct information about Data Science, so I decided to conduct this project to provide insights that will help to make the transition in the Data Science field much easier. In this project the Kaggle's 2020 Annual Survey was used to explore the following questions: 
<li>How to get started in data science  </li>
<li>What is the salary distributio of Data Sciebtist   </li>
<li>What are the tools that are used to process data   </li>
<li>What does a Data Scientist do? </li>
</ol>


# File Description
A Jupiter notebook is provided with the analysis of the survey results of Kaggles's 2020 annual survey. In this notebook I used various libraries such as numpy,pandas and matplotlib to develop simple but powerfull models for this project. The models were amalgamated in functions  that captured the data and return profound insights that can be used by anyone who has some degree of interest in the Data Science field.
