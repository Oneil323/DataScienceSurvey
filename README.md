# Projection Motivation
Information relating to the  Data Science field is ubiquitious on the internet but it still seems a bit overwhelming when it comes to finding basic information because most authors are too technical and write at a low abstraction level this cause some begginers to get confuse about Data Science and what it is really bout. I was definetely confused when I first sarted out, as such I am cognizant of how difficult it is to get the correct information, so I decided to conduct this project to help people make a smooth transition  in the Data Science field. In this project the Kaggle's 2020 Annual Survey was used to explore the following questions: 
<li>How to get started in data science  </li>
<li>What is the salary distributio of Data Sciebtist   </li>
<li>What are the tools that are used to process data   </li>
<li>What does a Data Scientist do? </li>
</ol>


# File Description
A Jupiter notebook is provided with the analysis of the survey results of Kaggles's 2020 annual survey. In this notebook I used various libraries such as numpy,pandas and matplotlib to develop simple but powerfull models for this project. The models were amalgamated in functions  that captured the data and return profound insights that can be used by anyone who has some degree of interest in the Data Science field.
